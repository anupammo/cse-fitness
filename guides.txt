We are looking for a website designer/copywriter/developer to work a long term basis.
With this project, we choose the person or a team that will keep working with us in the future.

Your task is to re-design our corporate website with new logos and colors. See the new brand book as attached.
Current website www.cse.fitness and one of our product page www.iwall.fitness.
I have made a mockup to give some ideas on what this new page would look. https://cse.fitness/2020/fi/ don't mind the content.

the structure would be something like this
- Home
- Company
- - Open positions
- - Investor info
- Products (ecommerce)
- - iWall
- - tapWall
- - runBEAT
- - cycloBEAT
- - groupBEAT
- - groupBEAT Home Studio
- - rehabWall
- Customers (or references)
- - School
- - Family Entertainment Center
- - Shopping mall
- - Fitness Club
- - Rehabilitation
- - Travel
- - Advertisers
. Exergaming
- Contact

So we need a submenu or dropdown menu, I leave that decision to you.
May the best design win!
